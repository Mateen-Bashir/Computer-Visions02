🖼️ Computer Vision Lab Tasks (OpenCV – Jupyter Notebook)

This repository contains multiple Computer Vision mini-projects implemented using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Image in Jupyter Notebook.

📌 Initial Image Processing Operations

✔ Basic Image Handling

Load image using OpenCV

Convert BGR → RGB for visualization

Convert to Grayscale

Resize image

Display using Matplotlib subplots

Save processed images

🚀 Implemented Features

1️⃣ Image Quality Enhancer (Social Media Ready)

Automatic brightness & contrast adjustment

Histogram-based clipping

Resize to 1080×1080 (Instagram format)

Side-by-side comparison (Original vs Enhanced)

2️⃣ Security Camera Grayscale Archiver

Convert colored image to grayscale

Save grayscale version for storage efficiency

Visual comparison display

3️⃣ Image Comparison for Duplicates

Resize images to uniform size

Convert to grayscale

Compute:

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)

Display comparison results

4️⃣ Color Filter for Object Detection

Convert image to HSV color space

Apply red color mask using HSV range

Detect and highlight red objects

Show original vs detected output

5️⃣ License Plate Blurring (Privacy Protection)

Define ROI (Region of Interest)

Apply Gaussian Blur

Replace region in original image

Save protected image

🆕 Additional Implemented Tasks

6️⃣ Custom Image Watermarking Tool

Load main image + PNG watermark

Supports watermark with or without transparency

Adjustable opacity

Centered watermark placement

Proportional resizing based on image size

Save final watermarked output

7️⃣ Basic OCR Preprocessing Pipeline

Load scanned document

Convert to grayscale

Apply noise removal (Gaussian / Median filtering)

Apply thresholding for clean text extraction

Prepare image for OCR engines

8️⃣ 2×2 Photo Collage Generator

Upload 4 images

Resize to uniform dimensions

Arrange into 2 rows × 2 columns grid

Save final collage image

9️⃣ Batch Color-to-Grayscale Converter

Read all images from directory

Convert each to grayscale

Save with _bw suffix

Designed for print shop black-and-white workflows

🔟 Noise Removal in Scanned Documents

Read noisy scanned image

Apply Gaussian Blur or Median Filter

Apply thresholding

Improve readability for documentation

🔄 Navigation Flow

Each task follows the same structure:

Load Image

Preprocess (if required)

Apply Core Operation

Display Results (Matplotlib Subplots)

Save Output using cv2.imwrite()

Print Confirmation Message

This consistent workflow ensures clarity, readability, and easy debugging.
